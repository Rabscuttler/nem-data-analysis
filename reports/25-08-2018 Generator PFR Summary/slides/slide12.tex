\begin{frame}{GTPS for Connection after 5/10/2018}
\begin{itemize}
\item Schedule 5.2.5 of NER includes GTPS for connection
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S5.2.5.3} - Response to frequency disturbance
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MAS & AAS - Minimum ride-through times for various frequency bands
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S5.2.5.8} - Protection from disturbances
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MAS - Facilities to automatically and rapidly reduce output by at least half if frequency exceeds level nominated by AEMO (not less than upper limit of OFTB - $\pm$ 1 Hz)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S5.2.5.11} - Frequency control
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MAS - not work against frequency control and \textit{capability} of operating in frequency response mode
        \item AAS - not work against frequency control and \textit{capability} of operating in frequency response mode such that could provide all FCAS services
        \item Frequency response mode must automatically provide proportional response
    \end{itemize}
