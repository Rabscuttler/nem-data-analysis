\begin{frame}{Summary of Observations}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Data lag
\begin{itemize}
    \item inconsistency in data lag for one interconnector
    \item leading correction needed if interested in response magnitude rather than time?
    \item \textbf{no lag correction/leading applied to Causer Pays dataset}
\end{itemize}
\item Generator response
\begin{itemize}
    \item Predominantly no or withdrawn PFR for synchronous units
    \item No response from inverter-based renewables except for GPS
    \item Most interesting responses in SA and QLD where frequency deviation outside NOFB was sustained
\end{itemize}
