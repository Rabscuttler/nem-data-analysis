\begin{frame}{Generator Response}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operating modes as described in \cite{Undrill2018}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Droop mode or droop-dominated mode, where droop response is sustained. Load controller does not interfere,
        \item Prescheduled output mode without frequency bias, where initial PFR withdrawn by load controller to scheduled load setpoint
        \item Prescheduled output mode with frequency bias, where load controller moves unit to offset scheduled load setpoint after iniial PFR. Offset dependent on system frequency
        \item AGC mode
        \item Non-responsive mode
    \end{itemize}
