@article{Erenoglu2019,
abstract = {This paper was written in order to examine the order of discovery of significant developments in the history of electricity. The history of electricity reveals a series of discoveries with the simplest discoveries being made first and more complex discoveries being made later. Some discoveries could not be made without certain prior discoveries having been made. The earliest forms of electricity to be experienced by people were those that occur naturally such as lightning and those resulting from simple activities like rubbing an object which causes electricity by means of friction. Systematic experimentation concerning electricity began after the scientific revolution with scientists constructing simple machines to create electricity and conducting simple experiments that showed electric charges could be positive or negative and that insulating material could stop an electric charge being lost from a charged object. Current electricity required the prior discovery of a battery such as the voltaic pile, and only when current electricity could be made, was it possible to discover the connection between electricity and magnetism. Once current electricity was produced, it was soon discovered that an electric current affected the behaviour of a compass needle, leading to the invention of the electromagnet and eventually to Faraday's invention of the electric motor and the electric generator. When practical electric generators and motors were invented, and the generation of electricity became economic, helped considerably by the invention of the electric light, the use of electricity began to spread throughout the first world and eventually the rest of the world. The order in which these discoveries were made was inevitable and given how valuable electricity is to human beings, it was also inevitable, that sooner or later in some society open to new ideas and technology, that electricity would be used to meet human needs. The order of discovery was inevitable and is an example of how social and cultural history has to follow a particular course determined by the structure of the world around us.},

Since communications in the SG environment use various wireless technologies, there is a high possibility that a malicious adversary can intercept, modify, delete, and interrupt the transmitted messages between the communicating entities. In addition, smart devices in the SG environment can also be physically compromised by an adversary. Therefore, in this chapter we develop a taxonomy on various security protocols aimed at the SG environment, which includes key management, authentication, access control, trust computing, privacy-preservation, and intrusion detection systems. We discuss the threat model and various security requirements as well as attacks related to the SG environment. Next, we present various security solutions based on the taxonomy of security protocols we have developed. Finally, we discuss various security platforms that are deployed and implemented in the SG environment.},

abstract = {The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) commenced in 1998 and spans the longest interconnected AC grid in the world. Most generation is coal-fired, but significant gas-fired capacity has been developed since market start in response to rising peak demand. Until the early 1990s, virtually all electricity was supplied through vertically integrated state monopolies. These monopolies have now been disaggregated and many of their component businesses privatized. Generation and retailing activities are now largely open to competition, while monopoly transmission and distribution networks are subject to independent economic regulation. The NEM is an energy-only market and prices have generally performed well in encouraging investment where and when it is efficient. However, the mounting cost of climate change policies has offset many of the initial gains. Recent regulatory issues have focused on network "gold-plating", with some concerns expressed about generator market power and vertical integration. Completion of the reform process requires further privatization and additional retail tariff liberalization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. Web Resource The book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

abstract = {This research atempts to generalize an approach for large-scale, non-layered spatial extrusion. The methodology consists of splitng a volume, representng any arbitrary geometry, into discrete fragments with a finite number of possible arrangements. These fragments are combined in response to a series of design criteria. A novel application of graph theory algorithms is used to generate a contnuous and non-overlapping path through the discrete segments. Physical and mechanical issues related to extrusion technology are explored. The computational model takes into consideration the grade and limitations of different kinds of equipment and material propertes to counteract fabrication errors with the goal of speeding up the process and eliminatng any need for human intervention. This approach is implemented as a cross-platorm software product and programming library that can generate robot programs compatble with multple industrial robot manufacturers. A physical prototype was fabricated using the seminal Pantion Chair as a test model. We conclude that the computational approach is sound and most of the issues encountered were due to the equipment used. This will be addressed in future work.},

abstract = {With the increase of converter-fed devices such as renewable energy sources, energy storage, electric vehicles, direct current transmissions and power electronic loads in the power system, the conventional synchronous generator (SG)-dominated power system has been gradually evolving toward a converter-dominated system. Power electronic interfaces (PEIs) can be controlled to emulate the frequency responses of SGs, but their inherent control mechanisms are quite different. As a result, the revolution of frequency regulation in the future converter-dominated power system is foreseeable from theory to practice. In this paper, the principle of frequency responses and the corresponding control strategies of PEIs are summarized. The major inherent differences between PEIs and SGs are clarified, and the distinctive releasable energy reserves and frequency response performances are revealed. The state-of-the-art frequency regulation strategies adopted by PEIs in different operation modes are reviewed. The multiple time-scale frequency behavior in converter-dominated power systems is presented. Some major technical challenges for future work are highlighted.},

abstract = {Efficient wholesale electricity markets should drive preference revealing bidding where generators offer the majority of their power at their short run marginal cost (SRMC). However, most renewables have very low SRMCs, which in a competitive market is likely to lead to an increasing proportion of low priced periods. Combined with concerns around the variable availability of some renewable generation types, this has led to suggestions that energy-only markets may need to be augmented with capacity remuneration mechanisms as their renewable penetration grows. This analysis explores the operation of energy-only markets with high renewables, with a case study of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Results suggest that existing energy-only market mechanisms have the potential to operate effectively in a 100{\%} renewables scenario, but success will rely upon two critical factors. Firstly, an increase in the Market Price Cap is likely to be required. Preliminary analysis suggests this may need to increase from the present {\$}13,500/ MWh in the NEM to the range {\$}60,000 to {\$}80,000 /MWh. Alternatively, comprehensive demand side participation could allow each customer to select their preferred level of reliability and associated cost, removing the need for an administratively determined Market Price Cap. Secondly, a liquid and well-functioning derivative contracts market will be required to allow generators and retailers to hedge increased market risks successfully.},

abstract = {United States' Wind Vision report envisions wind energy to generate 20{\%} and 35{\%} of nation's electricity by 2030 and 2050 respectively. Taking in to account of the aforementioned vision, the electric power industry is promoting generation of wind power and integration into the US interconnection grids. Over the last decade, this fast growing grid connected wind power generation has raised several new technical, regulatory and economic concerns for grid operations and electricity markets. Therefore, it becomes essential to perform research study and determine possible solutions for the integration of high penetration levels of wind power with the power grid. This paper focuses on the grid integration issue associated with deteriorated frequency response of power system when significant levels of wind power generation is present in the total generation mix. A brief review of the recently introduced frequency response regulatory standards and requirements for wind power plants in United States is presented along with the turbine manufacturer's advanced grid technology upgrade options to maintain the power system reliability. This paper evaluates the provision of ancillary services such as Emulated Inertial Response (EIR) and Primary Frequency Response (PFR) by wind generation resources, and investigates the impact of different control architectures on frequency response metrics. Further, it discusses the costs, benefits and other economic impacts associated with the various frequency control techniques of wind power plants. Finally, guidelines and priorities for wind turbine manufacturers, generating entities, balancing authorities and regulators are provided to ensure the increased reliability without additional costs.},

abstract = {Australia's National Electricity Market is an important global test case of the impacts of electricity sector transition in a large-scale liberalized energy-only market. The integration of variable and distributed energy resources has provided opportunities for clean, low-cost generation, but has also challenged existing market frameworks and resulted in a debate about the necessity for new designs. The market's delayed and insufficient response to disorderly retirement and the need for certain system services have resulted in government and system operator intervention to bridge the gap. There are difficulties in securing timely new investment under policy uncertainty and integrated capital models. Furthermore, contributions to system services that were previously provided as a consequence of energy provision are not inherently provided by many new-generation technologies. A range of solutions have been proposed to address these challenges, although none to date have harnessed the potential of comprehensive alignment between operational requirements and economic signals. For example, the government's flagship National Energy Guarantee, while providing a new framework for emissions intensity and reliability, did not address the ‘missing markets' in energy security. Measures such as forward markets may provide hedging options, but are limited to energy. Centralized commitment could provide operating robustness, but might not be able to provide sufficient transparency of the various electricity value streams, as the experience of international markets shows. Furthermore, while reliability has taken centre stage in the policy discourse, system security is as important in managing a large- scale complex grid with a significant share of asynchronous generation. We argue that an efficient and transparent real-time energy market must reflect the comprehensive operational requirements of electricity dispatch. This necessitates an extension of energy-only design to an ‘energy+services' model in which efficient price signals are provided for the ‘missing products' necessary for operational security. Clear service specifications provide transparent signals that enable clear price discovery and facilitate competition from new providers and technologies.},

abstract = {Power systems are the most complex systems that have been created by men in history. To operate such systems in a stable mode, several control loops are needed. Voltage frequency plays a vital role in power systems which need to be properly controlled. To this end, primary and secondary frequency control loops are used to control the frequency of the voltage in power systems. Secondary frequency control, which is called Load Frequency Control (LFC), is responsible for maintaining the frequency in a desirable level after a disturbance. Likewise, the power exchanges between different control areas are controlled by LFC approaches. In recent decades, many control approaches have been suggested for LFC in power systems. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey on the topic of LFC. In this survey, the used LFC models for diverse configurations of power systems are firstly investigated and classified for both conventional and future smart power systems. Furthermore, the proposed control strategies for LFC are studied and categorized into different control groups. The paper concludes with highlighting the research gaps and presenting some new research directions in the field of LFC.},

abstract = {In this paper a high level functional architecture for frequency and voltage control for the future (2030+) power system is presented. The proposal suggests a decomposition of the present organization of power system operation into a 'web of cells'. Each cell in this web is managed by a single system operator who assumes responsibility for real-time balance and voltage control of the cell, minimizing the dependency on inter-cell communication for secure system operation. The web-of-cells architecture ensures overall system stability by a combination of decentralized and distributed control patterns for frequency and voltage control. In each control cell, the operator maintains an accurate view on the overall cell state, based on adequate monitoring capabilities, and ensures secure operation by allocating and dispatching reserves located in the cell. Intercell coordination provides for efficient system-wide management and economic optimization.},

abstract = {As renewable energy penetration increases and system inertia levels drop, primary frequency response is becoming a critical concern. To address this problem the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is introducing a Fast Frequency Responsive (FFR) reserve product to the electricity market that helps to arrest frequency decline in the event of a large generator outage. This reserve type is required to be capable of nearly instant deployment of allocated reserve, which differs from traditional Primary Frequency Responsive (PFR) reserve that exhibits ramping limitations on power output. This paper derives a real-time co-optimization problem from first principles that ensures the reserve allocation is sufficient to arrest frequency decline before reaching some critical frequency threshold. The reserve constraints that are introduced capture the coupling between PFR reserve, FFR reserve, and system inertia, which is assumed constant in the context of the real-time market. Numerical results illustrate this coupling via a realistically large representation of the Texas power system.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide an econometric analysis of the most important determinants of Swedish households' choice to pay a price premium for "green" electricity. We draw on recent developments in the literature on integrating norm-motivated behavior into neoclassical consumer theory, and assume that individuals have a preference for keeping a self-image as a morally responsible person. Consumer behavior in the "green market place" will then be heavily determined by how purchases of different goods affect this self-image. The analysis is based on postal survey responses from 655 Swedish households, which are analyzed within a binary choice econometric framework. The results indicate that the impact of choosing "green" on the household budget largely influences the choice between "green" and "brown" electricity, as does the degree of perceived personal responsibility for the issue and the felt ability to affect the outcome in a positive way. We find limited support for the notion that perceptions about others' behavior in general affect individual moral norms and ultimately expressed behavior, but this is also complemented by the influence of explicit social influence. The difficulty in observing others' purchases makes it however difficult to distinguish between social and moral norms in the case of "green" electricity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper explores how enhanced flexibility through lower minimum load levels (also called "turndown" limits) for coal- and natural-gas-fired power plants can impact operations and profitability. Using soft-linked capacity planning and unit commitment models, this research examines the economic value of this flexibility and variation across different regions, generation asset types, and market environments (e.g., level of renewable deployment). Model results suggest that lower minimum loads are most valuable for mid-merit units with intermediate capacity factors, policy conditions that rearrange the merit order (e.g., carbon pricing), regions and scenarios without seasonal layup of assets, and units that are more flexible than generators with otherwise similar characteristics. Lower minimum loads can increase operating hours, increase net revenues, and decrease startups and long-run maintenance costs. The scenarios in this analysis show that plant flexibility affects operations more than annual profitability, which may have a higher system value for integrating renewables than a private value for the flexible unit. For many plants, the modest changes in net revenues with lower minimums mean that the focus will likely be on making operational modifications to increase flexibility rather than on capital investments. Additionally, this analysis quantifies how revenues from ancillary services markets can boost the value of lower minimum loads, especially for efficient natural gas units, but total market size and depth are uncertain.},

Many policies are justified by citing this theorem, or rather folklore versions of it. Several technical reasons as to why the price mechanism may fail to function efficiently are well known. This paper focuses on some more basic and 'social' qualifications of the fundamental theorem. First, it is argued that the popular assumption that individuals maximise utility "everywhere" is a meaningless one; and it can precipitate the Russell paradox. It is then argued that social norms play a crucial role in the functioning of markets. Finally it is shown that social norms, customs and even political power structures can be sustained in an atomistic market through a network of interpersonal conjectures and sanctions. It has been suggested that for understanding real-life economics it is necessary to bring institutions and power relations into our formal models. The method followed in the present essay may be viewed as one way of attempting this.},

abstract = {The Australian National Electricity Market is widely considered a successful example of electricity industry restructuring. It has delivered reliable electricity supply with apparent economic efficiency gains over the former monopoly utility arrangements, and in the context of significant industry challenges including peak demand growth and a changing generation mix. However, to date it has largely failed in reducing greenhouse emissions although this was an explicit target of public policy when restructuring initially commenced. This chapter explores the reasons for this divergent performance and possible options to address it. While commonly ascribed to a lack of political will, restructuring itself has also created difficulties for effective climate action through a narrow economic focus that resulted in: the creation of large politically powerful market incumbents opposed in many cases to improved environmental outcomes, retail market arrangements encouraging competition in energy sales rather than in efficient provision of desired energy services, and poor governance of external climate policies. There are also more fundamental challenges with the current market framework that will need to be addressed for low-carbon industry transformation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper accepts the widespread view that as electricity generation systems transition towards a greater proportion of renewables provision, there will be an increasing need for storage facilities. However, it differs from most such studies in contrasting the private incentives of a storage operator with the public desirability of bulk storage. A key factor in the context of a market such as Britain, where renewable energy largely means wind generation, is the nature of wind generation itself. The problem of wind's high variance and intermittent nature is explored. It is argued that not only is there a missing money and a missing market issue in providing secure energy supplies, there is also a missing informational issue. A key opportunity for new storage is participation in a capacity market, if the setting is right.},

abstract = {Electrical energy is transmitted from supply-side equipment to end-use equipment almost instantaneously and in accordance with physical laws. This is facilitated by the deployment of ancillary services that maintain the availability and quality of the electricity being supplied, thereby reducing the likelihood of an expensive supply interruption. Ancillary services play an important role in restructured electricity industries because they enable the commercial transactions of an electricity spot market to be implemented. In order to establish competitive arrangements for the sourcing, pricing, deployment and cost-recovery of ancillary services, issues including the formal specification of the services, the design of commercial decision-making mechanisms and the implementation of interfaces between commercial and technical processes must be addressed. This paper describes how these issues are addressed in the Australian National Electricity Market, reviews the outcomes to date and assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the arrangements. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern about the security implications of running a low-inertia power system resulting from the extensive penetration of variable renewable energy sources that are connected through power electronic interface. In this context, this paper focuses on the analysis of frequency response adequacy of the power system operated by National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia. Frequency response adequacy refers to the capability of a given portfolio of resources to maintain the frequency excursion characteristics within certain limits following a contingency event. Analysis for both generation and transmission contingencies events is conducted, with reference to the whole NEM and to South Australia as specific case studies. The analysis aims to provide clear insights into the relation between system inertia, frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), and the maximum allowed limits of the frequency excursion after contingency. To this end, specific frequency response security maps are introduced as a tool to represent the frequency excursion limits on a primary frequency response vs inertia chart. Several system conditions are studied, with results illustrating fundamental system limits with regards to secure operation, as well as exemplifying potential ways to reduce the frequency stability risk of the future NEM.},

This paper represents a comprehensive overview of power system flexibility as an effective way to maintain the power balance at every moment. Definitions of power system flexibility from various aspects are explained to reach the reliable and economic planning and operation of the power system. The effects of the high penetration of variable energy resources on power systems and the evolution of flexibility in response to renewables are studied. A variety of resources during the flexibility evolutionary transition are introduced and discussed. As an influential flexibility solution in current power systems integrated with renewable resources, market design improvement is widely reviewed in this paper, and required modifications in market design mechanisms are investigated pertaining to various time horizons.},

The specific potential impact of extreme events on energy systems has been difficult to quantify due to the unpredictability of future weather events. Here we develop a stochastic-robust optimization method to consider both low impact variations and extreme events. Applications of the method to 30 cities in Sweden, by considering 13 climate change scenarios, reveal that uncertainties in renewable energy potential and demand can lead to a significant performance gap (up to 34{\%} for grid integration) brought by future climate variations and a drop in power supply reliability (up to 16{\%}) due to extreme weather events. Appropriate quantification of the climate change impacts will ensure robust operation of the energy systems and enable renewable energy penetration above 30{\%} for a majority of the cities.},

abstract = {A major contribution from the economics of regulatory practice in electricity markets is the usefulness of marginal cost pricing. In recent years, expanded supply of low cost natural gas, increased energy efficiency, growing market penetration of renewable electricity sources, and substantial reserve margins have contributed to low prices reflecting low marginal costs in wholesale energy and capacity markets. These low prices have placed some existing generation assets at financial risk and altered incentives for new investment. While low prices should indicate ample generation capacity, some observers fear they fail to represent the long run scarcity value of electricity and thereby undermine resource adequacy. This paper explores four paradigms for the future of the electricity sector in a low marginal cost world, including traditional cost of service, energy-only power markets, energy plus capacity payment mechanisms, and new relationships between providers and consumers on an energy platform. These paradigms are evaluated for their ability to achieve efficient long-run outcomes in the industry and other criteria.},

At present, these wind/PV generators continue to increase their visibility as a source of cleaner electricity generation, and play a significant role in the electricity market's energy plans. Along with the increasing levels of wind/PV penetration in power system networks, there is an increasing concern over the network frequency response especially under the loss of a large synchronous generator. It is widely agreed upon that the frequency response has become more susceptible with the increase of wind/PV generation due to the lack of inertial support from these generators. This paper aims to review the recent literature into the system frequency response in the likelihood of the sudden loss of a large conventional generator with the increasing penetration of wind/PV generation. This literature review attests that existing primary control support schemes may not provide adequate frequency support for some networks with an increase of wind/PV generation. The prominent finding is that system operators do not have access to any specific tool that would allow them to determine the required frequency support on a real-time basis.},

abstract = {Will the global energy transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy be gradual or rapid? This key issue for the 2020s has profound implications for governments, energy producers, technology providers as well as industrial and private consumers. But, more importantly, the difference between a gradual and rapid transition will determine the climate future of humanity. A gradual transition will mean that the goals of the Paris Agreement will be badly missed. A rapid transition will give humanity a chance to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and keep temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius. Intending to both inform and spark further debate, this White Paper compares the two transition scenarios for our energy future, setting out two clearly different narratives. The Gradual narrative is that the energy world of tomorrow will look roughly the same as that of today – implying that the global energy system has an inertia incompatible with the Paris Agreement. The Rapid narrative is that current and new clean energy technologies are rapidly supplying all the growth in energy demand and together with new policies will reshape markets, business models and patterns of consumption leading to a peak in fossil fuel demand in the course of the 2020s. Whether the world will follow a path of a gradual or rapid transition will also make a significant difference to business across the energy spectrum. The rapid transition will bring new opportunities but the need to adapt to faster change will be greater. While the global energy system and the factors that impact it are more complex than any scenario or narrative can capture, this paper builds on different existing scenarios and summarizes the main ways in which they differ. It also highlights what to look for over the course of the next decade to see which narrative plays out. The Global Future Council on Energy 2018-2020 strives to inform the debate and decisions for the near- and long-term energy future. While acknowledging lead authors Kingsmill Bond, New Energy Strategist, Carbon Tracker Initiative; Angus McCrone, Chief Editor, BloombergNEF; and Jules Kortenhorst, Chief Executive Officer, Rocky Mountain Institute, this White Paper includes significant input and insights from our Council (see the list of members at the end of the paper).

abstract = {Led by energy and environmental policies the EU power sector is undergoing vast changes to achieve a market driven and sustainable future. Market based price discovery and different renewable support schemes are seen as key solutions in achieving the desired future production mix. Most liquid power markets use marginal cost based price discovery where the price is set by marginal costs of the last producer needed to cover all load, usually a fossil fuel power plant. At the same time the majority of new investments are made with significant help from government support schemes in renewable production capacities, which have very low marginal costs. The increasing share of renewable production will thus impact price levels in day-ahead markets. This paper analyses the potential impact of more renewable electricity production on price discovery in the NordPool Spot market, which already has a high share of renewable electricity traded. Results show that ceteris paribus NordPool Spot is likely to have very high price volatility in the future and alternative revenue sources are required for new investments.},

abstract = {The growth of non-synchronous variable renewable energy generation poses new operational challenges for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). One such challenge is managing grid frequency as power system inertia falls. Inertia is a property of a power system provided by rotating masses in generators and loads which are coupled to the system's electrical frequency. Coal, gas and hydro generators provide inertia to the NEM but wind and photovoltaic (PV) generators do not. Inertia is a valuable property because it lowers the rates of change of frequency (RoCoF) the power system experiences. Inertia acts against frequency disturbances caused by contingencies, such as the sudden loss of a large thermal plant, instantaneously, automatically and proportionally, hence reducing RoCoF and assisting in frequency restoration. With the prospect of falling inertia and hence higher RoCoF as wind and PV penetrations grow, an important issue for the NEM is whether its present regulatory frameworks ensure sufficient frequency control in the very short term. The NEM's current frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) include 6 second, 60 second and 5 minute contingency markets. In the future, additional measures for procurement of inertia or alternative fast frequency response resources with response times in the order of 1 second may be necessary to secure the power system. The study presented in this paper explores procurement of such resources through market arrangements with a dynamic requirement for total system inertia. A unit commitment model is used to simulate NEM dispatch in MATLAB with differing penetrations of wind and PV generation and a dynamically set requirement for total system inertia. In some modelling scenarios, in addition to synchronous generators, inertia may be sourced from devices such as synchronous condensers. The study also considers synthetic inertia from wind generators as a potential resource for providing fast frequency response. A number of mechanisms for recovering the costs of payments for inertia are also modelled. This study provides new insights into the potential impacts of market-based approaches to deliver inertia or very fast frequency response. In particular, the costs of inertia can be reduced by: 1. Allowing synthetic inertia from wind generators to be bid into inertia markets. 2. Installation of synchronous condensers. 3. Increasing the system's allowable RoCoF. 4. Using a cost recovery mechanism that penalises generators in proportion to their relative requirement for tight frequency controls. These results suggest that commercial frameworks that accommodate a variety of existing and emerging technologies are likely to be most suitable for the NEM in a high renewable energy future.},

In many cases, current PV costs and the associated market and technological shifts witnessed in the industry have not been fully noted by decision-makers. The perception persists that PV is prohibitively expensive, and still has not reached 'competitiveness'. The authors find that the commonly used analytical comparators for PV vis a vis other power generation options may add further confusion. In order to help dispel existing misconceptions, some level of transparency is provided on the assumptions, inputs and parameters in calculations relating to the economics of PV. The paper is aimed at informing policy makers, utility decision-makers, investors and advisory services, in particular in high-growth developing countries, as they weigh the suite of power generation options available to them. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The fundamental theory, the operating range, and the modifications needed for the wind turbine to contribute to the inertial and primary frequency response during the frequency drop will be presented in this paper. We will demonstrate practical approaches to allow variable slip and speed wind turbines to contribute inertia to the host power system grid. The approaches are based on the inclusion of frequency error and the rate of change of frequency signals in the torque control loop and pitch control actions for wind speeds below and above its rated value.

The increasing penetration of variable renewable energy production and thus the use of power converters are fundamentally changing the dynamic behaviour of the power system. The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview on the latest advancements of system operators regarding the analysis and mitigation of the reducing inertia. The theoretical background of power system stability and the calculation of the rate of frequency change are introduced to highlight the importance and the weaknesses of certain metrics used by system operators. Specific operational experiences are compared based on peak load and the nature of the systems. Possible responses by system operators which are discussed in the paper include synchronous and synthetic (emulated) inertia, other technical alternatives (virtual synchronous machines, adaptive load-shedding schemes), and market-based solutions. Besides summarising the advantages and disadvantages of those, grey areas of regulation and market structure are highlighted to facilitate forward-thinking.},

Key socio-economic challenges include issues of policy and regulation, such as maintaining physical network infrastructure at a time when regulated revenues are dwindling. Fundamentally, however, an electricity system exists solely to serve a social function, and without the “engagement”—be it consent, buy-in, or active leadership—of the people who interact with the system, the barriers to smart grids are likely insurmountable. While “smarter” consumer responsiveness to prices and access to data about consumption patterns can reduce overall costs, real questions remain unanswered about the role of citizens and what they need what they want, and what they will permit.},

@article{Bird2014,
abstract = {Curtailment is a reduction in the output of a generator from what it could otherwise produce given available resources, typically on an involuntary basis. Curtailment of generation has been a normal occurrence since the beginning of the electric power industry. However, owners of wind and solar generation, which have no fuel costs, are concerned about the impacts of curtailment on project economics. Operator-induced curtailment typically occurs because of transmission congestion or lack of transmission access, but it can occur for a variety of other reasons, such as excess generation during low load periods, voltage, or interconnection issues. Market-based protocols that dispatch generation based on economics can also result in wind and solar energy plants generating less than what they could potentially produce. This report examines U.S. curtailment practices regarding wind and solar generation, with a particular emphasis on utilities in the western states. The information presented here is based on a series of interviews conducted with utilities, system operators, wind energy developers, and other stakeholders. The report provides case studies of curtailment experience and examines the reasons for curtailment, procedures, compensation, and practices that can minimize curtailment. Key findings include: • In the largest markets for wind power, the amount of curtailment appears to be declining even as the amount of wind power on the system increases. Curtailment levels have generally been 4{\%} or less of wind generation in regions where curtailment has occurred. Many utilities in the western states report negligible levels of curtailment. The most common reasons for curtailment are insufficient transmission and local congestion and excessive supply during low load periods. • Definitions of curtailment and data availability vary. Understanding curtailment levels can be complicated by relatively new market-based protocols or programs that dispatch wind down or limit wind generation to schedules and the lack of uniformity in data collection. • Compensation and contract terms are changing as curtailment becomes of greater concern to solar and wind plant owners. Increasingly there are negotiated contract provisions addressing use of curtailment hours and there is greater explicit sharing of risk between the generator and off-taker. • Automation can reduce curtailment levels. Manual curtailment processes can extend curtailment periods because of the time needed for implementation and hesitancy to release units from curtailment orders. • Market solutions that base dispatch levels on economics offer the advantages of creating transparency and automation in curtailment procedures, which apply equally to all generators. • Curtailed wind and solar resources may provide ancillary services to aid in system operations. • A variety of solutions is being used to reduce curtailments: transmission expansion and interconnection upgrades; operational changes such as forecasting and increased automation of signaling; and better management of reserves and generation.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The energy needs of the global population are changing rapidly based on the smart grid technologies, power requirements of each country, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation, and the policies to reduce the number of people without access to electricity. The public concern regarding a clean energy requirement has promoted distributed energy resources (DERs) to be considered as the promising alternative to global power demand based on low operation and maintenance costs, cost of energy (COE) reduction, and improvement of energy efficiency and security of power supply. The increase in the global population coupled with the rapid growth in the world economy has forced many utilities to integrate DERs into their power systems. The rapid growth in the deployment of DERs for a number of applications by the distribution system operators and consumers has been attributed to numerous socio-economic benefits. Owing to this, it is universally accepted that the application of DERs will take a proactive part in optimal operations of the power systems. The main challenges that are associated with the operation of conventional generating units such as the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming can be overcome with the utilization of renewable DERs that have many economic and environmental benefits. The characteristics and importance of each component of DERs are presented in this chapter.},

The book has grown and been adapted to keep up with the fast pace of change in derivatives markets. Like earlier editions, the book serves several markets. It is appropriate for graduate courses in business, economics, financial mathematics, and financial engineering. It can be used on advanced undergraduate courses when students have good quantitative skills. Also, many practitioners who are involved in derivatives markets find the book useful. I am delighted that half the purchasers of the book are analysts, traders, and other professionals in derivatives and risk management. One of the key decisions that must be made by an author who is writing in the area of derivatives concerns the use of mathematics. If the level of mathematical sophistication is too high, the material is likely to be inaccessible to many students and practitioners. If it is too low, some important issues will inevitably be treated in a rather superficial way. I have tried to be particularly careful about the way I use both mathematics and notation in the book. Nonessential mathematical material has been either eliminated or included in end-of-chapter appendices and in the technical notes on my website. Concepts that are likely to be new to many readers have been explained carefully, and many numerical examples have been included. Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives can be used for a first course in derivatives or for a more advanced course. There are many different ways it can be used in the classroom. Instructors teaching a first course in derivatives are likely to want to spend most classroom time on the first half of the book. Instructors teaching a more advanced course will find that many different combinations of chapters in the second half of the book can be used. I find that the material in Chapter 35 works well at the end of either an introductory or an advanced course.},

However, since stochastic and non-dispatchable renewable energy resources participate in the electricity market, they inject power generation uncertainty. Thus, new services such as ancillary services are required to equilibrate balancing markets. Hence, simultaneous clearing of joint energy and reserve day-ahead and balancing markets makes this process more efficient. In this chapter, sequential and simultaneous approaches are used to study a two-stage stochastic joint energy and reserve market-clearing problem. In the sequential model, the day-ahead and balancing stages are solved autonomously. Moreover, this chapter evaluates the impact that electrical loads' flexibility behaviors has on the provision of operating reserves.},

abstract = {With the increasing deployment of solar systems in buildings in urban environments, a future scenario of high photovoltaic penetration is expected to produce impacts on the distribution grid. One of the challenges relates to the power balance at the power transformers, which might not have sufficient spare capacity to accommodate the solar electricity feed in. In this work, we estimate the power balance at the transformers in a small urban area of Lisbon, Portugal, considering full deployment of PV, installed on rooftops and building fa{\c{c}}ades. The PV potential is estimated through two different approaches: the simplified Peak power method, which considers the typical peak power of a module and the available area, and the more labour-intensive Irradiance method that accounts for hourly time step solar irradiance and demand data or simulations. The main findings of this work point out that the Peak power method has limited success if PV facades are to be considered. Moreover, a high PV penetration scenario leads to a locally less resilient grid, hence a solar PV factor was proposed to account for future deployment of PV systems in urban environments.},

While the potential of these massive data is undoubtedly significant, fully making sense of them requires new ways of thinking and novel learning techniques to address the various challenges. In this paper, we present a literature survey of the latest advances in researches on machine learning for big data processing. First, we review the machine learning techniques and highlight some promising learning methods in recent studies, such as representation learning, deep learning, distributed and parallel learning, transfer learning, active learning, and kernel-based learning. Next, we focus on the analysis and discussions about the challenges and possible solutions of machine learning for big data. Following that, we investigate the close connections of machine learning with signal processing techniques for big data processing. Finally, we outline several open issues and research trends.},

abstract = {superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to reduce the minimum voltage and to increase the maximum speed under certain conditions, but there are some harmful side-effects. First of all, the electrostatic pressure can push water into the surface pores, which hinders actuation. The phenomenon can also be treated as a vertical electrowetting effect. Another drawback is that the use of superhydrophobic surfaces makes actuation more critical to the properties of the liquid. For example, actuation of biological buffer solutions was not successful. For these reasons, it is concluded that it is more beneficial to use a smooth surface with low hysteresis than a superhydrophobic surface in droplet actuation. Electrostatic droplet actuation is a potential method for manipulating liquid on a microscopic scale, but there is still work to do. This work contains a detailed examination of the droplet actuation mechanism, and trapping of charges in the solid-liquid interface is found to be the most severe problem that needs to be solved.},

FAST FREQUENCY RESPONSE IN THE NEM – WORKING PAPER {\textcopyright} AEMO 2017 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As the energy market transforms, the nature of frequency control in the National Electricity Market (NEM) will change as new services are likely to be needed to complement existing mechanisms. This provides opportunities for applications of fast frequency response (FFR) to play a role in complementing existing frequency control. The breadth and speed of technological change in the power industry is unprecedented and parts of the NEM are leading the world in terms of new generation penetration. Thus whilst urgency is needed, research and analysis is still evolving in how these new technologies can be best applied to large, complex power systems. This report aims to develop a common language for discussion across industry, and provide early guidance on the suite of FFR services that may be valuable in future to assist in the efficient management of power system security. In this context, AEMO invites stakeholder feedback. Figure 1 summarises the opportunities identified for FFR and how they relate to existing frequency control mechanisms in the NEM. In this way, FFR may be beneficial in:  Delivering faster frequency control and lower cost.  Reducing constraints on power flow imposed by risks of high rates of change of frequency.},

Iceland, for example, supplies 100{\%} of its electricity needs with either geothermal or hydropower. Other countries that have electric grids with high fractions of renewables based on hydropower include Norway (97{\%}), Costa Rica (93{\%}), Brazil (76{\%}), and Canada (62{\%}). Hydropower plants have been used for decades to create a relatively inexpensive, renewable form of energy, but these systems are limited by natural rainfall and geographic topology. Around the world, most good sites for large hydropower resources have already been developed. So how do other areas achieve 100{\%} renewable grids? Variable renewable energy (VRE), such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, will be a major contributor, and with the reduction in costs for these technologies during the last five years, large-scale deployments are happening around the world.},

abstract = {Full decarbonisation of the electricity system is one of the key elements to limit global warming. As this transition takes place, the electricity system must maintain system adequacy and remain affordable to consumers. In liberalised electricity markets investors are seen as key actors driving this transition. Due to the intermittent character of renewable assets, such as wind or solar parks, electricity systems with large shares of renewable electricity will need to become increasingly flexible. Evaluating whether specific market designs provide the right incentives to invest in flexibility, requires the simulation of realistic investor behaviour. Agent-based modelling provides the means to explore heterogeneous, imperfectly informed and boundedly rational investor behaviour within different electricity market designs. We evaluated two market designs; “energy-only” markets and markets with a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM). We conclude that energy-only markets, even with strong carbon pricing, do not incentivise investors to deliver a fully renewable, reliable and affordable energy system. Therefore policy makers should focus on developing CRMs which can work in combination with market incentives to reach a fully renewable, reliable and affordable electricity system in the second half of this century.},

The purpose of this study is to comprehensively review the existing markets to study advantages, issues involved and lessons learnt to benefit emerging electricity markets. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a comprehensive review of existing competitive electricity market models in USA (California), UK, Australia, Nordic Countries (Norway), and developing country (Chile) to analyze the similarities, differences, weaknesses, and strengths among these markets based on publically available data, literature review and information. Findings: Ongoing or forthcoming electricity sector restructuring activities in some countries can be better designed based on lessons learnt from existing markets and incorporating their own political, technical and economical contexts. A template for design of successful electricity market has also been presented. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to a comparative analysis of five markets and can be extended in the future for other existing and emerging electricity markets. Practical implications: The discussed weaknesses and strengths of existing electricity markets in this study can be practically utilized to improve the electricity industry market structures leading to several social benefits including lower electricity cost. Originality/value: The comprehensive review and analysis of five existing markets, physically located in different continents, may be used as an assistance or reference guide to benefit the emerging electricity markets in other countries. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

@article{Ela2011,
abstract = {With the advent of new technologies being introduced to the electric power system, the way in which the system is planned and operated may need significant changes. For instance, variable renewable generation, like wind power and solar power technologies, have some very different characteristics than traditional sources of generation technology that has historically met the electricity demand. The variability and uncertainty that is inherent in variable generation technologies adds to the variability and uncertainty in the existing system and can have significant effects on operations. Variability is the expected change in generation and demand balance (e.g., load changing throughout the day and wind power resource change). Uncertainty is the unexpected change in generation and demand balance from what was anticipated (e.g., a contingency or a load or variable generation forecast error). Power system schedulers often use scheduling techniques throughout the day to match generation and demand. When, because of variability and/or uncertainty, the total supply of energy is different than the total demand, system operators must deploy operating reserves to correct the energy imbalance. The way in which they do this and, especially, the way in which they plan for this can dramatically impact the reliability and efficiency of operating a power system with large amounts of variable generation. Systems today have developed their rules and practices based on a long-standing history of operations. Many systems are even now learning new ways to change these rules and practices where high penetrations of variable generation are becoming apparent. Renewable integration studies that are assessing the impacts of future high penetration systems are finding that systems must find alternative approaches for allocating and deploying operating reserves. This report tries to first generalize the requirements of the power system as it relates to the needs of operating reserves. A categorization of the various types of operating reserve is introduced to give a better understanding to the reader and to link similar reserve definitions in regions that have different naming conventions. It also includes a survey of operating reserves and how they are managed internationally in system operations today and then how new studies and research are proposing they may be managed in the future with higher penetrations of variable generation. The objective is to understand the differences, the commonalities, and to inspire thought on how new methods or metrics would be better suited in this future power system with larger amounts of variable generation.},
